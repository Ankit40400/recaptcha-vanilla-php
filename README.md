# Google reCAPTCHA V2 Server-Side Validation

The repo includes a complete sample code of how server-side Google reCATPCHA validation works. *(Front-end validation is also included)*

In `environment.php`, you must add `sitekey` and `secretkey` provided when you create a reCAPTCHA.

It's best to add those keys in environment variables as no one should have access to your `secretkey`.

I also made tutorial about the server-side validation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzGpDbeSuA).
