# Server-side Google reCAPTCHA Validation

The repo includes a complete sample code of how server-side Google reCATPCHA validation works. *(Front-end validation is also included)*

In `environment.php`, you must add `sitekey` and `secretkey` provided when you create a reCAPTCHA.

It's best to add those keys in environment variables as no one should have access to your `secretkey`.
